Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fei Sun](http://ofey.me/). Previously, I obtained my B.E. in Software Engineering from Nankai University. My research interests include Knowledge Editing, NLP, Trustworthy AI, and Recommender System.
